# Retrospective for the Todo List Project

- The Todo List project was an interesting and valuable experience. It involved creating a web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Throughout the development process, there were several aspects that went well, and there were some areas that could be improved upon in future projects. Here's a retrospective of the Todo List project:

## What Went Well

- Functional Core: The core functionality of the Todo List application was successfully implemented. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, and the data is stored and retrieved accurately.

- UI Design: The UI design was simple and user-friendly. The use of colors and fonts made the application visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Responsiveness

- The application was designed to be responsive and displayed well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

- Code Organization:
 The project was well-organized with clean and modular code. The separation of concerns made it easy to maintain and understand the codebase.

- Use of External Libraries:   The integration of external libraries, such as Google Fonts, helped improve the aesthetics and functionality of the application.

## Areas for Improvement

Testing: While the core functionality was implemented successfully, there was a lack of comprehensive testing. Future projects should prioritize testing to ensure all features work as expected.

Accessibility: The application could be improved by considering accessibility standards. Ensuring that the app is accessible to users with disabilities will expand its usability and reach.

Error Handling: Better error handling and validation for user inputs could prevent unexpected behavior and improve the overall robustness of the application.

## Learnings

Project Planning: Proper planning and defining clear project requirements are crucial for a successful development process.

Documentation: Maintaining thorough documentation aids in understanding the project and facilitates collaboration with others.

coding: because of lack of experience we took much time and also couldn't refactor the code as expected. but by doing this project some concepts are more clear.

Overall, the Todo List project was a rewarding experience that taught important lessons in separation of concern.  It provided valuable insights into building interactive small website and the importance of user-centric design.Taking the learnings from this project into account will contribute to creating even better applications in the future.
