## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

1. **Add Task**

   - As a user, I want to be able to add a new task to my to-do list so that I can keep track of what I need to do.
   - Given a task description and due date, when the user clicks the "Add" button, then the task should be added to the list.

2. **View Tasks**
   - As a user, I want to view a list of all the tasks in my to-do list so that I can know what tasks I have pending.
   - Given the to-do list, when the app loads, then all the tasks should be displayed.

3. **Edit Task**
   - As a user, I want to be able to edit the details of a task in my to-do list so that I can update its description or due date.
   - Given an existing task, when the user clicks the "Edit" button, then the task details should be editable.

4. **Remove Task**
   - As a user, I want to be able to remove a task from my to-do list so that I can unclutter and manage only relevant tasks.
   - Given an existing task, when the user clicks the "Delete" button, then the task should be removed from the list.

## Should-Haves

> these will complete the user experience, but are not necessary

1. **Task Priority**
   - As a user, I want to prioritize tasks with different levels of importance.
   - Given a task, when the user sets the priority level, then the task should be visually distinguished based on its priority.

1. **Task Completion Status**
